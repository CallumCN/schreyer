# Schreyer Honors College undergraduate thesis data analysis program

analysis.ipynb contains code that I wrote to analyze Indian survey data for my undergraduate honors thesis at Schreyer Honors College at Penn State University. It functions when run in Google Colab with the data files on which it runs in Google Drive's "Colab Notebooks" folder.

The data files include education.xlsx, production.xlsx, Individuals.sav, Households.sav, and Women.sav. I consolidated data from the India's SSE and ABEE surveys to create education.xlsx, and from the Reserve Bank of India to create production.xlsx. Both files, along with my honors thesis and the analysis program's output (data.xlsx and analysis.xlsx), are available at https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/8812ccn5107. Individuals.sav, Households.sav, and Women.sav are renamed SPSS files from the India Human Development Survey and are available at https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/DSDR/studies/37382/datadocumentation, where they are respectively named “DS3 Individuals - Wide Panel (Public-Use)”, “DS9 Households - Wide Panel (PublicUse)”, and “DS15 Eligible Women - Wide Panel (Public-Use)”.
